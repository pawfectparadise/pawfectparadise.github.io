    <p class="color-gray text-left call-mar">Every decision on infrastructure , processes , rules are made keeping in mind the dogs’ perspective and needs – physical and mental.

We at PetFelix are very aware of this and take all possible steps to keep DOG first!</p>

    <p class="color-gray text-left call-mar">We have Individualized , dog specific playtime for each dog depending on its breed , age and overall temperament. We have separate spacious 50 sqare feet enclosures for all our doggy guests. This ensures individualized comfort and attention. It also allows for a greater sense of security. Imagine your small dog sleeping next to a large aggressive dog in the open….albeit chained at some distance. The small dog will be at constant discomfort with this large aggressive dogs presence…not to mention the actual risk of being at the receiving end of some aggression. Separate enclosures also act as a barrier to spread of diseases / infection between dogs.</p>

The place is spacious, with a well-equipped play area and air-conditioned kennels. The level of hygiene and safety meets highest standards. Dogs are taken for outdoor walks to do their business and have indoor playtime where the staff play with them and make them run around. Videos are sent daily to keep pet parents updated. Pick up and drop facility are available. Thanks to the owner and the staff for taking good care of our baby!

							<div class="testimonial"><i class="fa fa-quote-left quoteicon"></i>My pet is my World to me! Travelling even for a couple days would mean I had to look for a care centre that could meet a mother's expectation. I heard about Petfelix from a friend. I visited it and was impressed to see a large open space for my pet to play and run around. There were airpurifiers installed in the kennel thus when I landed in, it was clean air that I breathed myself. I observed there were time schedules fixed for each dog to come out for playtime and nature's call. What else, dogs were pampered with their favourite meal. My pet is a hyperactive dog. She was anxious initially. She wouldn't come in control. The care takers gently lifted her up to calm her down everytime they had to take her out. I couldn't have asked for more when Mr Oberoi asked me if my pet loved ice creams and long drives. I kept getting regular videos of my pet which kept me calm and relieved. Mr Oberoi went out of the way to get Ghee chapatis from home as my pet was not eating anything initially. My pet loves to sun bathe, so she was made to stay in the den that received maximum sunlight. What else can a pet parent ask for!! When I came to pick up my baby, I met a super energetic and happy baby. Only one wish! If only some windows could be made in the dens for more sunlight. Over all, I am super pleased with PetFelix! The thought behind the concept of dog boarding and handling so many dogs in such a perfect, individualised way goes to tell how much has gone into planning and feeling it. Thank you Mr Oberoi for bringing a difference to pet boarding!

I left my beagle puppy here for the first time when she was just 5 months old. They fed her and exercised her with fun playtime on the schedule I gave. They even send you videos of your pet eating and playing on a daily basis so that you are worried about your pet. The first time because she was a small baby she caught cold because of the ac. I let the owner Mr. Oberoi know about it and on the next two visits he took care that she is assigned a kennel which is not too close to the AC. The owner is a really great guy who personally takes care of all the needs and even the health he your pet. Great place! Highly recommended!</div>

As any pet parent, we were apprehensive about his well being, feeding away from home. Right from discussing the plan of keeping Leo with Petfelix and Sarvmeet's entire step by step guidance about having a trial stay (that too complimentary!) for a day before the actual vacation etc was very reassuring. We realised then and there that we were leaving our baby in good hands. During the vacation regular video updates after every meal and play session were further confirmation of excellent service provided by entire team. Really happy with the facility! Thank you so much Petfelix.</div>

Jack, a very sweet but a dog that is apprehensive of his surroundings by nature, came back with change in his attitude.. He became more slimmer &amp; fitter in his last stay.. Now he walks around with same caution - but with extra confifence.. And Stella has come back even more active than what she already was.. Their human interaction has increased, they are more open to it, and so has their patience to deal with the presence of other dogs around..

The pop up for Petfelix, came as a surprise for us when we were hunting for the right spot for our buddy Oreo to be housed at in our absence for vacation.

Being avid pet lover since my childhood, I was very keen on ensuring the place is right for my buddy. Regarding Petfelix, let me quote the right words, Mumbai may not have best facility for your loved pets than this concept, brainchild of Sarvmeet. Absolutely playful and so hygienic and well maintained.

Post stay at Petfelix, I can tell Oreo wants to be there again not only to play but enjoy with folks who ensure that your best friend is in safe hands.

We as family would really like to thank Sarvmeet and his team and family, who took so special care of Oreo in our absence. I donâ€™t think they made him even realise our absence during his stay. Guys best of luck and god bless you are doing great job and hope you continue the same.
